# Description
This is a fork of bthachdev/web_browser, to be modified by me and maybe released

This web browser is simple enough that it appears to be useful to turn into a
REAL project that does what MOST browser users want:  To have a browser that
TRULY protects privacy, TRULY gtives you control over ads and cookies and
tracking and OTHER HEINOUS STUFF, and is SIMPLE enough that it doesn't take
FOREVER just to load whenever you run it.

I intend to make sure it has a 3D Skeuomorphic interface, allows 'Noscript'
types of control over scripting, allows white/black lists and 'memory only'
cookies, allows you to customize the user agent to help combat tracking, and
other features as I think them up.


This project appears to have NO copyright.  However I will still attribute it
to its original author.  I expect to license the modified version under a dual
license of GPLv2 or an M.I.T.-like license, one that attributes the original
author.
